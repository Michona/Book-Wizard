# Overview

Sample app demostrating usages of [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture). Libraries used:
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) for data persistence
* [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) for Json string parsing

## Improvement

Ideas and comments for improving the app:
* Move to using some dependency injection framework (Dagger 2)
* Write unit/UI tests. 
* Utilize Data Binding (expecially with the [ListAdapter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/recyclerview/extensions/ListAdapter))
